        <h2 class="subtitles">Background</h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            The Responsibility to Protect initiative is a global political commitment which was endorsed by all member states of the United Nations at the 2005 World Summit to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. While R2P has been in existence since being drafted in 2005, the UN has struggled to transform this initiative from concept into policy and was looking for a new strategic visual identity to assist them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitles">Challenge</h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            We were tasked with creating a visual identity with an underlying strategy that could convey the message of R2P with a logo and tagline, so that each nation’s public could recognize and desire the integration of the Responsibility to Protect policy.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitles"> Strategic Insights</h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            Coming up with a simple yet resonant logo that could be easily drawn and replicated by anyone, our visual identity was compelling, clear, and packed a meaningful message in concordance with our tagline. Additionally, the roll out strategy presented at the United Nations gave credence to the effectiveness of “going big” and deciding to lend faith to an increasingly globalized and connected world.
