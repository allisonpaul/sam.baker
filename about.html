            “A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” <br><span id="author">-Robert A. Heinlein</span>

        <div id="bio">
            <p>Sam has been a musician, farmer, auto mechanic, military cadet, political campaign manager, recruiter, writer, and consultant—in that order. He’s done most of the things Robert A. Heinlein thinks humans should be able to do, but really thinks kindness and compassion are the two “shoulds” (Sorry, Rob). </p>

            <p>He reads incessantly.</p>

            <p>He's bilingual and has lived in cultures that could not be more disparate. </p>

            <p>He has a meditation practice. </p>

            <p>Sam is a strategist.</p>
