	<h2 class="subtitles">Challenge</h2>
	<p class="info-text">
			PBS was looking for an agency partner to establish an approach for measuring consumer engagement and to define and build a best-in-class digital tool to be used internally by PBS to aggregate and share research around consumer insights.

			This central hub was intended to allow the PBS employee to gain a comprehensive and immersive view of the PBS consumer, their experience with PBS programs and services, and gauge how well PBS was engaging with them through all of their distribution and communication channels. The tool was to be customized so that the user could be able to modify their view of the data for easy access to the information most relevant to them.

	</p>
	<h4 class="subtitles"> Strategic Insights</h4>
	<p class="info-text">
			Through a comprehensive brand and business audit, we discovered that all current consumer research and materials were sent to each individual member station in a singular report. In addition to this being counterintuitive, it proved to be difficult for any one user looking for specific consumer insights to find relevant information.

			Through speaking with member station affiliates, we discovered that regional member stations corresponded with each other to gain consumer insights and looked to each other in terms of strategic planning and resource allocation.

	</p>
	<h5 class="subtitles">Results</h5>
	<p class="info-text">
			We devised a central hub that was built on a delayering structure, so that any member station could speak to stations that were either similar to them in size, content production, or location -- and so that all information (from both corporate and local affiliate stations) could be found in one centralized place.
