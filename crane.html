        <p class="info-text">
            For over 200 years, Crane stationery has produced the finest paper for the most important invitations. From Paul Revere to Jaqueline Kennedy, Crane’s customer base has been knowledgeable to the intricacies of formality and have always relied on Crane to provide them with the finest of materials. After selling their currency business in early 2016, (yes all of our paper money was also printed on Crane paper for 200 years), Crane & Co. began to notice that this generation did not lean as heavily on being over-formalized in sending invitations-- and came to us to see if we could help garner interest in a younger audience.

        <h4 class="subtitles"> Insights and Opportunities</h4>
        <p class="info-text">
            We were tasked with creating tangential business opportunities which would help Crane & Co modernize and also fit into their current business model. This generation being much more self defined than previous generations, we looked to the rising rate of millennial entrepreneurs for a place to introduce Crane. As other groups were working on a combination of physical and digital personal invitations, our strategy “Begin with Crane to Launch Your Career” included partnerships with Bond (so that entrepreneurs could save their handwriting digitally and type handwritten letters), bespoke orders on LinkedIn, options for ordering business cards when making personal websites,  and permanent partnerships with collaborative workspaces such as Neuehouse, Soho House, and WeWork so that start ups and entrepreneurs were given knowledge of and access to stationery.
