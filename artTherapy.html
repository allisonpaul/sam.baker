        <h2 class="subtitles">Background</h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            For five years, the Art Therapy Outreach Center has been successful in giving their clients great care (and with excellent qualitative results). This organization, looking to expand, came to the School of Visual Arts’ honors program (something I was very proud to be apart of) in search of ways to make themselves more relevant and publically relatable. Unbeknownst to them, the majority of their external messaging put on airs of apology for the discipline they practice—and at times was unintentionally demeaning to the values each of the lovely members of the organization embody on a day-to-day basis. A lot of this was due to their original brand architecture, which we were tasked with rebranding.

        <h2 class="subtitles"> Strategic Insights</h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            While in the throes of this intensive rebranding process, my colleagues and I began to notice a few trends entering mainstream New York culture: “Paint and Sip” art studios offering the experience of gathering together with friends to drink wine and paint, and the emergence of popularity in adult coloring books. While this may seem laughable to the general public, my team and I found the exact opposite to be true. The majority of ATOC’s external messaging was apologetic towards art-as-therapy-- as it is not as relatable to the public as traditional talk therapy-- but culture was saying otherwise. We came to find that the qualitative experience of art-as-therapy provided a beautiful and culturally relevant brand narrative, combining the intuition of the cultural zeitgeist with the public’s relatability to the empirical benefits of traditional talk therapy.
