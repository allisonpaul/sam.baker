                We were tasked by Ken Carbone, founding partner of Carbone Smolan Agency, to utilize of his famous Unify, Simplify, Amplify methodology to extended a legacy brand into a new arena of business. The project being academic in nature, my team and I decided to choose Jeep-- doing a deep historical business and brand audit in order to uncover what new market Jeep would be best fit to enter.

            <h2 class="subtitles"> Strategic Insights</h2>
            <p class="info-text">
                The findings from our audit led us to a number of clues as to which direction Jeep could take in a new sector. Taking a look at Jeep's history, we found that Jeep was the first mass production four-wheel drive vehicle and that it was originally sold to the military-- and later to farmers as a vehicle that can get to hard to reach places, and finally as a family vehicle. Seeing this proliferation of progression from military to consumer vehicle-- tied to the philosophy of a pride in ruggedness and ability to get to places others' can't-- we pinpointed a market that was copasetic with Jeep's existing brand narrative and business model.
