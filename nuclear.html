	<h2 class="subtitles">Background</h2>
	<p class="info-text">
			For the culmination of our academic careers at the School of Visual Arts’ Masters in Branding program, a team and I applied for and were tasked with the issue of raising awareness around the issue of nuclear security. Knowing little to nothing of what the issue meant at the time, we chose the topic for the intellectual gravitas it possesses and with the feeling that we could assist in raising awareness around something important. What we came to find is an issue that is perhaps most important to our survival as a species and, tragically, one that is paid very little attention. 
	</p>
	<h2 class="subtitles"> Challenge</h2>
	<p class="info-text">
			Since the end of the cold war, the perceived threat of nuclear catastrophe has been far from the minds of the American and global public. While this issue is shrouded in mixed messages of fear and nationalism in the generations that precede the cold war, the post cold war generations (Millennials and Generatian Z) were not exposed to the issue outside of a historical context. With a nuclear arsenal that is susceptible to human folly, aging, and growing increasingly vulnerable to malfunction due to deterioration, the challenge was bringing these imminent issues to the minds of these generations that are already predisposed to fatigue of other threats. 
	</p>
	<h2 class="subtitles">Insights and Oppurtunities</h2>
	<p class="info-text">
			While these generations are often seen as “slactivists”, studies have shown that the millennial generation is the most integrated into modern social causes. With the post cold war generations seemingly obsessed with a fear and interest in a post apocalyptic world (eg: popularity of The Walking Dead), presenting the issue of nuclear security in a manner that both empowered and interested this generation in making change around the proliferated nuclear arsenal was prioritized—So we created a brand that was historically rich, culturally relevant, and highly empowering to those who encounter the message.
